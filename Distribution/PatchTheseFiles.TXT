Please wait a minute before using the framework and edit the following files:

...\catalog.xml
...\SW\Saxon\CatalogManager.properties
...\SW\FOP\conf\userconfig.xml.1, if you use it -- see \SW\FOP\fonts\ReadMe.TXT why you might want to use it

In every file, replace all occurences of "MyDocBookInstallDir" with the
absolute path of the framework's root directory, e.g. "D:/SW/DocBookFramework".
Yes, use forward slashes, not backward slashes that are normally used in OS/2.
In future versions of the framework, this will be done automatically during
installation.
