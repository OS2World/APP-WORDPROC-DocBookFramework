XEP could not be included in the DocBook Framework for OS/2 due to its license.
You can download XEP from the following URL:

     http://www.renderx.com/tools/xep.html

Then, unpack XEP to this directory so that the xep.jar file resides in
the "lib" directory under the current directory. No other settings are
necessary.
