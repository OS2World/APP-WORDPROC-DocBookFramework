<h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ælfred</font></h2>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Included in the Saxon distribution is a modified version of the Ælfred XML parser 
originally developed by David Megginson at Microstar (no longer in existence).
 I have taken the relevant part of
 <a href="mailto:david-b@pacbell.net">David Brownell</a>'s
 <a href="http://home.pacbell.net/david-b/xml/">Ælfred2</a> distribution, repackaged it,
  and fixed a few bugs. All changes are clearly documented in the source code.</font></p>

</font><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The version included with Saxon is David Brownell's code of 26 Feb 2000,
modified as follows:</font></p>

<ul>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Changed the package name to com.icl.saxon.aelfred to prevent any accidental confusion with the
 original Microstar code or with David Brownell's version.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fixed several bugs: (1) a bug in namespace handling (where an attribute xxx:name precedes the xmlns:xxx
 declaration) (2) poor diagnostics when end of file occurs prematurely </font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subsetting the code to include only the XML non-validating parser and SAX driver, with appropriate
changes to the setFeature() and getFeature() methods.</font></li>
<li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some further changes made by David Brownell up to June 2001 have been incorporated.</font></li>
