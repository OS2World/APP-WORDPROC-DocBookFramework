If you want to use the alternative configuration file (userconfig.xml.1), save
the original file ...\SW\FOP\conf\userconfig.xml under a different name, rename
userconfig.xml.1 to userconfig.xml and put the following fonts into this
directory:

arial.ttf
arialbd.ttf
arialbi.ttf
ariali.ttf
cour.ttf
courbd.ttf
courbi.ttf
couri.ttf
times.ttf
timesbd.ttf
timesbi.ttf
timesi.ttf

The alternative configuration and the above fonts produce much better quality
of the resulting PDF file. Attention: Do NOT use the alternative configuration
for PostScript, you would get just some garbage :-(

And, of course, you must have the right to use the fonts.
